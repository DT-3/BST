# BST
A Binary Search Tree written in C++ 

A simple BST that I also wrote for class (datat structures and algorythims, go figure XD).
It is very similiar to the SLL I have on my porfolio bacause it utilizes a similiar node
system. The main method runs a loop that needs a user input when searching through the existing
BST that is created in the main method. It creates the BST from a series of strings from a txt file
called, "text.txt". The time complexity follows the rules of a BST which is O(h) - h being the height
of the tree.
